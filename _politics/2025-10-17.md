We've all seen the news. A huge shortage of entry-level jobs. Soaring rent, energy and grocery costs. House prices out of reach for a whole generation. Monopolistic companies squeezing every penny they can from consumers. Artificial Intelligence threatening to completely replace us. And the far right, leaping on this opportunity to blame the immigrants, so they can get into power and widen the wealth inequality gap even further.

And it's not just the news. I see it in my siblings who dreamed of a job no longer hiring. In my parents who manage with less and less each year. With my friends who have given up on a career, and the prospect of ever owning a house. The economy is broken. Our country is broken. And worst of all, our spirits are broken.

When was the last time you heard someone speak of hope? Of a vision for a more equal world. We're surrounded by news stories and YouTube videos explained how and why the world is burning. How often do they offer a solution?

I want this blog to be about solutions. Together, we'll dig into the issues facing the country today, and try to understand just a little better how we might tackle them. And maybe, spark a little bit of hope once more.
